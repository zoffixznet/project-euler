Two heads are better than one

An unbiased coin is tossed repeatedly until two consecutive heads are obtained. Suppose these occur on the (M−1)
th and Mth toss.
Let P(n) be the probability that M is divisible by n. For example, the outcomes HH, HTHH, and THTTHH all count towards P(2)

, but THH and HTTHH do not.

You are given that P(2)=35
and P(3)=931. Indeed, it can be shown that P(n)

is always a rational number.

For a prime p
and a fully reduced fraction ab, define Q(ab,p) to be the smallest positive q for which a≡bq(modp).
For example Q(P(2),109)=Q(35,109)=66, because 5⋅66=330≡3(mod109) and 66 is the smallest positive such number.
Similarly Q(P(3),109)=46
